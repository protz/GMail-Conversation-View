# Thunderbird Conversations

This extension improves the threaded summary for emails in Thunderbird. It
vastly improves the UI by including some ideas from GMail. More specifically:

- your own messages are displayed in the thread,
- you initially see summaries, they can be expanded to display full messages,
- quoted sections are collapsed Ã  la GMail,
- fast links for replying (and possibly other useful actions),
- you can reply inline (through a "quick reply" feature).

For screenshots and a stable version, please head to
[AMO](https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/addon/gmail-conversation-view/) which should
provide you with a ready-to-install package.

# Thunderbird support

We try to ensure the released version of Conversations supports at least the
latest released Thunderbird version.

Where possible, we also support the previous Thunderbird version, and the latest
Beta's. However, sometimes support may lag, depending on what changes have
recently been made in Thunderbird.
