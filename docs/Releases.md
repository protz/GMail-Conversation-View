# Releasing a new version

- Ensure the correct changeset is checked out
- Ensure `npm ci` has been run
- Ensure `npm test` has been run
- Ensure the build runs in the expected versions of Thunderbird
- Run `npm version <version>` (see below for details on `<version>`)
- Push the branch `git push upstream <branch>`
- Push the tag `git push upstream v<version>`

`<version>` is an major/minor/patch version number, with a possible pre-release
tag, e.g.

- 2.14.0
- 3.0.0
- 3.0.0-pre1
- 3.0.0-pre2
- etc.

It can also be just `patch`, `minor` or `major` depending on the release.

Lastly:

- Check that the xpi installs in Thunderbird and is the correct version
- Upload the xpi to the add-ons site.

Note: `npm run prod` is automatically run by the `postversion` npm routine.
